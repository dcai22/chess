The setup is complete.
Currently, the board is set up at the start, and players take turns moving one square into another square.
This is a naive implementation of movement, where there are no rules as to how each piece (or empty square) can move.
The game ends when a king is missing.

The rest of the CLI will simply be implementing the rules, i.e., move validation.
Here is a checklist of rules to implement:
 - A move must start from a pawn/piece of the same colour                                                                   DONE
 - The start and end square of a move must be different                                                                     DONE
 - For a regular move, the end square must be empty                                                                         DONE
 - For a capture, the end square must have a pawn/piece of the opposite colour                                              DONE
 - A move cannot result in the player's King being in check                                                                 DONE
 - Piece-specific rules:                                                                                                    DONE
    - Pawn:                                                                                                                 DONE
        - Can move, but not capture, 1 unit forward                                                                         DONE
        - On its first move, it may move, but not capture, 2 units forward, if the square in front is empty                 DONE
        - Captures can only be made 1 unit diagonally forward (captures 1 unit forward are not allowed)                     DONE
        - En-passant                                                                                                        DONE
            - If your opponent's previous move was a pawn moving 2 spaces forward, landing on your pawn's left or right,    DONE
              you may move your piece diagonally forward in that direction to capture the opponent's pawn
        - Promotion                                                                                                         DONE
            - If your pawn reaches the end of the board (8th rank for white, 1st rank for black), it is                     DONE
              replaced with any piece (but not pawn) of your choosing
            - The new piece should copy the Piece properties from the pawn to avoid bad castling logic                      DONE
    - Rook:                                                                                                                 DONE

        - A player can resign at any time, forfeiting the game

Rule implementation is complete. All that is missing is draw offers, resignation, and perhaps a chess clock.
Now I will do thorough error-checking, especially with the Square constructor.
Here are some other plans for the future:
 - Write unit tests using gtest
 - Create a frontend for the game
 - Build an AI chess bot

I also added [[nodiscard]] and noexcept appropriately to some functions.
