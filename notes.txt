The setup is complete.
Currently, the board is set up at the start, and players take turns moving one square into another square.
This is a naive implementation of movement, where there are no rules as to how each piece (or empty square) can move.
The game ends when a king is missing.

The rest of the CLI will simply be implementing the rules, i.e., move validation.
Here is a checklist of rules to implement:
 - A move must start from a pawn/piece of the same colour
 - The start and end square of a move must be different
 - For a regular move, the end square must be empty
 - For a capture, the end square must have a pawn/piece of the opposite colour
 - A move cannot result in the player's King being in check
 - Piece-specific rules:
    - Pawn:
        - Can move, but not capture, 1 unit forward                                                                         DONE
        - On its first move, it may move, but not capture, 2 units forward, if the square in front is empty                 DONE
        - Captures can only be made 1 unit diagonally forward (captures 1 unit forward are not allowed)                     DONE
        - En-passant                                                                                                        
            - If your opponent's previous move was a pawn moving 2 spaces forward, landing on your pawn's left or right,
              you may move your piece diagonally forward in that direction to capture the opponent's pawn
        - Promotion
            - If your pawn reaches the end of the board (8th rank for white, 1st rank for black), it is
              replaced with any piece (but not pawn) of your choosing
            - The new piece should copy the Piece properties from the pawn to avoid bad castling logic
            - I will promote to a Queen by default (promotion to any piece will be done in the future)
    - Rook:
        - Line of sight is horizontal and vertical                                                                          DONE
        - Can only move/capture in its line of sight                                                                        DONE
        - Is moved when castling (see King)
    - Knight:
        - Can only move/capture in an L-shape                                                                               DONE
    - Bishop:
        - Line of sight is along the diagonals                                                                              DONE
        - Can only move/capture in its line of sight                                                                        DONE
    - Queen:
        - Line of sight is horizontal, vertical, and along the diagonals                                                    DONE
        - Can only move/capture in its line of sight                                                                        DONE
    - King:
        - Can move/capture 1 unit in any direction (including diagonally)                                                   DONE
        - Castling
            - Only on its first move
            - King moves 2 units to its right (Kingside), or left (Queenside)
            - The Rook in the direction of castling cannot have moved
            - All squares between the King and relevant Rook must be empty
            - The King's current, final, and any intermediate squares cannot be attacked by the opponent
            - Counts as a move for both the king and the rook
    - Checkmate occurs when the player has no legal moves remaining
FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
    - Draws
        - Stalemate
        - Threefold repetition
        - Insufficient material
        - Fifty moves without a pawn move or a capture
        - Player offers and opponent accepts
    - Resignation
        - A player can resign at any time, forfeiting the game
